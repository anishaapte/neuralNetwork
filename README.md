# neuralNetwork
A neural network with one hidden layer that uses a dataset of 10,000 784x784 images for handwritten digits. Both layers use logistic regression for the activation function  and employs gradient descent with backpropagation for training and classification. The inferencing is done using n-fold cross validation.
